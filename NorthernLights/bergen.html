<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Bergen</strong></span> a colorful Norwegian city is a gateway to majestic fjords. Bryggen Hanseatic
 Wharf will give you a sense of the local culture – take some time to snap photos of
 the Hanseatic commercial buildings, which look like scenery from a movie set. Don’t breathe
 too deeply when you visit the outdoor fish market, a reminder of the city’s role in early fish trade. 
 Ferry across a fjord to Lysøen, where the former villa of 19th-century composer Ole Bull will captivate
 you with fairytale charm.<!--
Based around Norway's Seven Mountains, the seaside city of Bergen has 
been an important coastal centre of trade, commerce and politics for over 
a millennium. Known as the land of the midnight sun, Bergen -->

Bergen's first buildings were erected along the old, Hanseatic wharf, Bryggen, 
which has been a lively and important part of the city through the centuries.
 This site, which features on UNESCO’s World Heritage List, comprises the remains
 of the old harbour buildings and is one of the best known medieval city settlements in Norway.
The Hanseatic merchants dominated Bryggen for 400 years. The area has been ravaged
 by fire repeatedly. Walking through the narrow alleyways and dark external galleries is like 
 travelling back in time. At Bryggen the Hanseatic Museum and Schøtstuene, the Hanseatic assembly rooms,
 give an intimate picture of the life of a Hanseatic merchant.

Out of the dust and ashes
Bryggen, the old wharf in Bergen, is an exceptional example of a medieval district,
 and it has been designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO. In 1955 parts of Bryggen
 were ravaged by a fire, and during the subsequent excavations a huge number of objects
 were found that provide a vivid insight into commerce, shipping, handicrafts and everyday 
 life in medieval times.
